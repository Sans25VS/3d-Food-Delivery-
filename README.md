🍔 3D Burger App
Welcome to the 3D Burger App! This project is a dynamic, interactive 3D burger-building application created using React Native for cross-platform development, Three.js for rendering stunning 3D models, Drei for simplifying Three.js integration, and Zustand for efficient state management. Models are sourced from Sketchfab to provide an immersive, realistic experience.
